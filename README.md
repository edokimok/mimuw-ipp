# IPP - Individual programming project in C

Assignments for subject 'Individual programming project' at MIM UW.  
This subject consisted of two projects: a "small one" called 'Labyrinth' and a "big one" - 'Phone numbers'.

## Labyrinth

Program returns the shortest path beetween two given points in a multidimensional labyrinth represented by a k-dimensional cube.

## Phone numbers

The implementation of operations on phone numbers.  
For the purpose of the task, we assume that the phone number is a non-empty string consisting of the characters 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, * (10) and # (11).  

There are several functions implemented, some of them using a trie data structure.

The full description of the module interface can be found in the phone_phorward.h file.
